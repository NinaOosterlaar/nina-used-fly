# Fantasy Fest 2025

In the second weekend of October, Fantasy Fest 2025 took place in de Broodfabriek in Rijswijk.
Fantasy Fest is a large event for fans of fantasy, sci-fi, anime, manga, comics, and video games, basically everything remotely fantasy related.
Sebas and I are both really into fantasy books, and other nerdy stuff, so we decided to go.
The theme of this particular edition was "Night Time Circus", but I still do not know how that really impacted the experience.
Maybe if I go next time, I can compare the editions and see the differences.

## The Vibes

I have been to conventions before, specifically anime and Pokémon conventions.
People dress up in cosplay at these events as well.
However, at Fantasy Fest, the amount of people in cosplay was on a whole other level.
You are definitely in the minority if you are not dressed up in some way.
It does not have to be extreme or anything, but it definitely can be extreme.
From fairies, to vikings, from pirates to steampunk, from furries to cosplays, everything was there.
People looked absolutely stunning.
It is also worth mentioning that the diversity of people attenting was also very high.
There were old people and little children (both often dressed up).
There were also a lot of people with disabilities, more than I have seen at other events.
All body sizes were represented as well and all looked great in their outfits.
All in all, the vibes were very positive and welcoming.

The event is mainly focused on stalls where you can buy all kinds of fantasy related stuff.
But there were also some activities that you could do.
For starters, there was a stage with live folk music.
I discovered I really like folk music, it is surprsingly catchy.
At some point you can attend one big folk dance lesson, where a large group of people attend to learn some basic folk dances.
I did not participate, but it looked so fun!
