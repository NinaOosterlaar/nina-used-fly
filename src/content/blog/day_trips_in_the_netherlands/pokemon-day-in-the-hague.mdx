# UNIQLO Pokémon UT collection

The day before, UNIQLO released their new Pokémon UT collection, a collaboration between UNIQLO and the Trading Card Game.
Of course, I must buy some of these clothes.
So on the way to the Pokémon GO Tour, we stopped by the UNIQLO store in The Hague.
We frantically started searching for the clothes, and I fitted all of the shirts.
Sadly the sweaters were not available in The Hague, and the Gengar sweater that Sebas really wanted was sold out online as well...
I decided to buy the slowpoke shirt (purple) and the fossil shirt (white with greenish picture).
Then I suddenly stumbled upon the children section, and I saw the cutest Eevee sweater, that was sadly only available in children's sizes.
I was convinced that it would not fit me, but I gave it a try and it actually was okay!
It is certainly small, but in a cute way.
Maybe I am just desperate, since I love eevee too much.

# Pokémon GO Tour in Scheveningen

After shopping, and a quick lunch at the HEMA, we took the tram to Scheveningen.
The Pokémon GO Tour features a bus (or truck?) that visited a variety of European cities.
The Hague (or actually Scheveningen) was the Dutch location.
The bus was parked right in front of De Pier, which is in itself a busy spot.
So naturally, when we arrived at the bus, it was overcrowded.
Many people were dressed up in Pokémon merch, and there was even a dog wearing an Eevee costume, which was absolutely adorable.
The atmosphere, like any other Pokémon GO event, was very pleasant.
The bus featured some Pokémon GO props, but nothing too special.
However, in game the bus was surrounded by so many stops and gyms, specifically placed for the event.
This was of course why we were there.

Sebas and I started to orient ourselves (we did not do a lot of research on the event beforehand).
The main thing of this event are the special costume Pikachus with a Schevenignen background. 
When spinning pokestops, you could get a field research: Trade a Pokémon, which would give such a Pikachu.
The shiny rate of these pikachus were 1/10 which are amazing odds.
Soon enough, Sebas and I both had multiple shiny Pikachus!
After that, we started to do the raids.
The event coincided with Shadow Kyogre Raid Day, but as always my shiny Kyogre luck was terrible, and a pink Kyogre did not appear for me...
However, I did get some other random shinies (that I actually did already have, but still nice to get).

We also met up with some friends, caught up, and did some raids together.
It was nice seeing them again, since we had not seen them in a while because of the holidays.
I also got some delicious soft serve ice cream (vanilla and chocolate swirl) from the ice cream shop next to De Pier.
I had not had soft serve in a while, and it was delicious!

After a few hours, it was time to go home.
On the way, to finish the day, we stopped by a game store to buy some Pokémon cards.
This was a great end to a very nice Pokémon day.
