## DMZ Tour

The demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a buffer zone between North and South Korea. 
It was established at the end of the Korean War in 1953 and is one of the most heavily fortified borders in the world.
With a tour guide, you can actually visit this, if you are okay with waking up early.

### Gamaksan Chulleong Bridge

The tour that we chose also includes the red suspension bridge.
The red suspension bridge, actually called the Gamaksan Chulleong Bridge (also known as the Gloucester Heroes Bridge), is a prominent red suspension bridge in South Korea a short distance from the DMZ. 
This bridge, dedicated to British Korean War heroes, serves as a scenic crossing and viewpoint, offering panoramic views of the surrounding valley and mountains.

### Imjingak Park

Imjingak Park is a park located near the DMZ and is a popular spot for tourists. 
The park was built in 1972 to console the families of those who were separated by the Korean War.
The park contains many statues and monuments regarding the Korean War.
It also contains the freedom bridge, which crosses the Imjin river, and it was used by South Korean soldiers during the war.
Until 1998 it was also the only point of egress from South Korea to the DMZ.

The monuments include:
- Second Infantry Division Memorial, which is the first major US unit to reach Korea. 
It is said that the division's clerks, bandsmen, technical and supply personnel all helped to fight off the KPA (Korean People's Army from North Korea).
- 187th Airborne "Rakkasans" Memorial, which led the second and last parachute asssault in Korea in 1951.
- Chamorros of Guam Memorial, since 1000 Guamanians served in the US military during the Korean war. 20 people died.

- Mangbaeddan, which enables displaced people whose hometowns are located within North Korea to bow down to their parents or family in North Korea as a sign of respect during cultural events such as New Years and Chuseok (the Korean Mid Autumn Festival, which usually entails paying respect to your elders and ancestors). 
This memorial holds many sorrowful memories of separated families during the Korean War.
- Monuments to US Forces in the Korean War, built by the South Korean Ministry of Defense, to commemerate the sacrifice and achievements of US troops.
37000 Americans died.
- Peace train, the last train to cross the border between North and South Korea, a military transport delivering supplies to UN forces following MacArthur's inland push in 1950, became stuck at Hanpo Station in Hwanghe-do in what is now North Korea on December 31, 1950 due to Chinese troops ahead. Unable to turn around, the conductor attempted to back the train back down to Munsan but was stopped by US troops who decided that rather than risk the train falling into North Korean hands, were ordered to destroy the train. The locomotive was a KNR Mateo1 Class.

### The Third Tunnel

The Third Tunnel of Aggression is one of the four known tunnels dug by North Korea under the border into South Korea.
The tunnel was discovered in 1978 because of an underground explosion.
The tunnel is 1635 meters long, 1.95 meters high, and 2.1 meters wide. It runds 73 meters underground.
It was allegedly designed for a surprise invasion of South Korea and could accomodate 30.000 men per hour with light weaponry. 
There are assumed to be 20 more tunnels besides the four that are known.
Tourist can now visit the tunnel, but keep in mind that it is a steep walk down and up again, and it can be quite claustrophobic.

This can be seen through binoculars that are available for visitors.

According to North Korea, the village contains 200 families while the South Korean government claims it is uninhabited.

# Accommodations

## Henn Na Hotel Myeongdong

- Day 1-5
- Check-in from 15.00, check-out before 12.00
- Address: 59, Myeongdong 8ga-gil, Jung-gu, Jung-Gu, 04537 Seoul, South Korea

The Henn Na Hotel is a hotel branch from Japan that is known for its unique concept of incorporating robots into its services.
The location of this hotel is in the heart of Myeondong, a famous shopping district.
This location is not only central, but also extremely close to the meet up point for the DMZ tour.
And since you have to meet up early in the morning, I would say that is certainly a big plus.
There is an option to bring your luggage before check-in, which is also an absolute must.
An American breakfast is served. 
I would prefer traditional Korean breakfast, but since this is our first stop, a breakfast that is more familiar might be a good idea.
I think there are only two main downsides, the rooms are quite small according to reviews, and it is quite expensive.
However, with this location in Seoul, it is impossible to find something cheap. 

We booked two rooms, a twin room with two single beds and the Hollywood room with one extra large double bed.
The twin room should be quite basic, but the Hollywood room also promises a great view, so we will see about that.

## Rakkojae

- Day 20-22
- Check-in from 15.00, but need to notify in advance, check-out before 11.00
- Address: 218 Gahoe-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul

For our last two nights, we decided to stay at Rakkojae, a traditional Korean hanok stay, which is located in Bukchon Hanok Village.
Bukchon Hanok Village is a prime tourist spot in Seoul, known for its well-preserved traditional Korean houses (hanoks) and its picturesque streets.
To be able to fully experience the charm of this area, and to immerse ourselves in the traditional Korean culture, we have decided to stay at one of the Hanoks. 

So why is it special to stay in a traditional Hanok? 
Well, the houses are more than 100 year olds and preserve the architectural style and cultural heritage of Korea.
Staying in a traditional Hanok not only comes with the accomadation, but also with the experience.
When arriving in the village, you are welcomed with a traditional tea service. 
Furthermore, a traditional Korean or American breakfast is served in the morning.
Additionally, for free you can use their Natural Mud Sauna to relax, or try on a traditional Hanbok (Korean dress) and take pictures with it on their beautiful premise.
For an additional fee, you can also experience their Boksoondoga Makgeolli Skincare Bath, which is a bath with rice wine, known for its skin benefits, or you can listen to the sounds of a Gayageum performance.
You do have to keep in mind that all of these experiences are really traditional, so be prepared to sleep and sit on the ground, but that is of course also the charm.

We have booked the family suite called Sarangbang, which can accomadate up to four guests.
