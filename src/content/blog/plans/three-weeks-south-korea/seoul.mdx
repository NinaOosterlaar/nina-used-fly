Unable to turn around, the conductor attempted to back the train back down to Munsan but was stopped by US troops who decided that rather than risk the train falling into North Korean hands, were ordered to destroy the train. The locomotive was a KNR Mateo1 Class.

## Palaces

In total there are 5 palaces in Seoul. 
We will not visit all of them, but some of them are definitely worth a visit.
We have already been to Gyeongbokgung Palace on day 4, but Changdeokgung Palace, and Changgyeonggung are also worth a visit.
They are both close to our hanok stay in Bukchon village, so we can easily walk there.

### Changdeokgung Palace

Changdeokgung Palace was the second royal villa built following the construction of Gyeongbokgung Palace in 1405. It was the principal palace for many kings of the Joseon dynasty.
The palace grounds are comprised of a public palace area, a royal family residence building, and the rear garden. Known as a place of rest for the kings, the rear garden boasts a gigantic tree that is over 300 years old, a small pond and a pavilion.

The palace gained importance starting from the time of Seongjong, the 9th king of Joseon, when a number of kings began using it as a place of residence. Unfortunately, the palace was burned down by angry citizens in 1592 when the royal family fled their abode during the Imjin War. Thanks to Gwanghaegun, the palace was restored in 1611.

# Accommodations

## Henn Na Hotel Myeongdong

- Day 1-5
- Check-in from 15.00, check-out before 12.00
- Address: 59, Myeongdong 8ga-gil, Jung-gu, Jung-Gu, 04537 Seoul, South Korea

The Henn Na Hotel is a hotel branch from Japan that is known for its unique concept of incorporating robots into its services.
The location of this hotel is in the heart of Myeondong, a famous shopping district.
This location is not only central, but also extremely close to the meet up point for the DMZ tour.
And since you have to meet up early in the morning, I would say that is certainly a big plus.
There is an option to bring your luggage before check-in, which is also an absolute must.
An American breakfast is served. 
I would prefer traditional Korean breakfast, but since this is our first stop, a breakfast that is more familiar might be a good idea.
I think there are only two main downsides, the rooms are quite small according to reviews, and it is quite expensive.
However, with this location in Seoul, it is impossible to find something cheap. 

We booked two rooms, a twin room with two single beds and the Hollywood room with one extra large double bed.
The twin room should be quite basic, but the Hollywood room also promises a great view, so we will see about that.

- Day 20-22
- Check-in from 15.00, but need to notify in advance, check-out before 11.00
- Address: 218 Gahoe-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul

For our last two nights, we decided to stay at Rakkojae, a traditional Korean hanok stay, which is located in Bukchon Hanok Village.
Bukchon Hanok Village is a prime tourist spot in Seoul, known for its well-preserved traditional Korean houses (hanoks) and its picturesque streets.
To be able to fully experience the charm of this area, and to immerse ourselves in the traditional Korean culture, we have decided to stay at one of the Hanoks. 

So why is it special to stay in a traditional Hanok? 
Well, the houses are more than 100 year olds and preserve the architectural style and cultural heritage of Korea.
Staying in a traditional Hanok not only comes with the accomadation, but also with the experience.
When arriving in the village, you are welcomed with a traditional tea service. 
Furthermore, a traditional Korean or American breakfast is served in the morning.
Additionally, for free you can use their Natural Mud Sauna to relax, or try on a traditional Hanbok (Korean dress) and take pictures with it on their beautiful premise.
For an additional fee, you can also experience their Boksoondoga Makgeolli Skincare Bath, which is a bath with rice wine, known for its skin benefits, or you can listen to the sounds of a Gayageum performance.
You do have to keep in mind that all of these experiences are really traditional, so be prepared to sleep and sit on the ground, but that is of course also the charm.

We have booked the family suite called Sarangbang, which can accomadate up to four guests.
