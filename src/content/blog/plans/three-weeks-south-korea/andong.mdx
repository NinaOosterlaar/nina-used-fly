# Day 18

- Arrive from [Gyeongju](/blog/plans/three-weeks-south-korea/gyeongju) (1.5 hour drive) by car in the morning.

## Confucian Academy

## Woryeonggyo-Bridge

# Day 19

- Leave Andong in the morning to go to [Sokcho](/blog/plans/three-weeks-south-korea/sokcho) (1 hour drive).


# Accommodation

## Airbnb in Weonju

Our accomodation is actually not in Andong, but in Weonju, which is located between Andong and Sokcho.
We chose this, because the drive between Andong and Sokcho is quite long (3.5 hours), and we wanted to break it up a bit.

- Check-in from 15.00, check-out before 11.00
- Address: 524 Sicheong-ro 단관청솔아파트 5차 503동1506호, Weonju, Gangwon Provincie 26469, Zuid-Korea
