# Day 11

- Arrive at the end of the day in Jeonju from [Naejangsan National Park](/blog/plans/three-weeks-south-korea/naejangsan-national-park) (1 hour drive)

Even though Jeonju is often included in travel itineraries, we chose to not spend too much time here.
That is because I heard conflicting reviews about the city.
Mainly because the hanok village is not a so called "authentic" hanok village, but built for tourism.
We will spend the night here, and leave early the next day.
However, we did book our accommodation in the hanok village, so we can at least experience staying the most important part of Jeonju.

## Jeonju Hanok Village

Jeonju Hanok Village is a large traditional village in the city of Jeonju, South Korea.
The village was built in the early 20th century, around important cultural heritages. 
It is home to over 800 traditional Korean hanok houses, making it the largest hanok village in Korea.
The area is very popular for tourism, attracting more than 7 million visitors annually.
The village is quite uniquely located, since it is in the middle of a modern city.
Overall it is a nice place to stroll around, and there are many cafes and restaurants in the area.
If you are in Jeonju, you should definitely check it out.

# Accommodation

We will stay in a luxurious house in the Jeonju Hanok Village.
It is not a traditional Hanok house, but it does have a jaccuzi, so what more can you want?
We have chosen this place, since it seems to be a great place to relax, which we need after waking up early in the Temple Stay and going to Naejangsan National Park.
Below you can find some pictures of the place.
