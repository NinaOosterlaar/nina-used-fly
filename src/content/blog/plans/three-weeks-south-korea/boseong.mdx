# Day 12

- Arrive from [Jeonju](/blog/plans/three-weeks-south-korea/jeonju) (2.5 hour drive) by car.

Boseong is an optional stop on the way to Busan. 
It is located more to the south of South Korea, which makes it a bit out of the way.
However, this also enables you to drive more closely to the coast, which I expect to be very beautiful.
The main reason to visit Boseong is its tea, and I do love my tea.

## Tea Fields

Boseong is famous for its green tea fields, which are some of the most beautiful in South Korea.
It is almost 27 hectares of tea fields. 
The rolling hills covered in lush green tea plants create a stunning landscape, especially in the spring when the tea leaves are freshly picked.
Visitors can stroll through the fields, take photos, and even participate in tea picking experiences.
From the pictures, this looks like an impressive place to visit.

## Tea Museum

The tea fields are also accompanied by a tea museum, which provides insights into the history and culture of tea in Korea.
It was built to preserve Korea’s tea culture and celebrate the history of Boseong tea, which dates back as far as the Baekje Era. 
Each of the three floors of the museum is unique and focuses on a different aspect of tea. 
On the first floor is the Tea Culture Hall, which explains the process of tea production through graphic panels, videos, and dioramas. 
The Tea History Hall on the second floor exhibits tea wares and tools from different periods in history, showcasing the evolution of tea culture over time. 
The third floor houses the Tea Life Hall, which is dedicated to education and hands-on experiences and gives visitors a chance to discover the tea cultures of Korea, China, Japan, and Europe as well as various tea tools from other countries. Visitors can further delve into the world of tea by visiting the Tea Making Workshop, which is equipped with facilities to make different types of green teas.
