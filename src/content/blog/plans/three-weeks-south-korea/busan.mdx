## Gamcheon Culture Village

When reading about Busan, Gamcheon Culture Village pops out a lot. 
You can certainly not miss this colorful village.
The village was formed by the settlement of refugees during the Korean War in the 1950s.
The houses were built in a staircase style on the foothills of a coastal mountain.
The many alleys that cut through this community are vibrantly decorated with murals and sculptures created by the residents.
Many art students and professional artists were tasked to transform the village into a cultural attraction in 2009, making it such a colorful and photogenic place to visit.
In 2015, the village had 1.4 million visitors.

## Nampo-dong

Nampo-dong is a central commercial district in Busan. 
There are multiple shopping streets, including a Lotte Department Store, and other things that I mentioned below.

### Jagalchi Fish Market

The Jagalchi Fish Market is Korea’s largest seafood market and a must-visit when in Busan.
It is located right by the sea, so you can expect to find a wide variety of fresh seafood here.
The market is divided into two sections: the indoor market, where you can find dried and processed seafood, and the outdoor market, where you can find live and fresh seafood.
You can also find many restaurants in and around the market that will prepare the seafood you buy for you to eat on the spot.
Most of the people who sell fish are women, so the vendors here are called Jagalchi Ajumeoni, "ajumeoni" meaning middle-aged or married woman in Korean.

### BIFF square

Busan’s modern movie district was originally little more than a pair of cinemas that were built following Korea’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule over half a century ago. 
However, major renovations took place ahead of the first Busan International Film Festival (BIFF), and the newly transformed district was named BIFF Square on September 13, 1996.
Having been remade into a cultural tourist attraction promoting the advancement of Korea’s film industry, BIFF Square has contributed to Busan’s status as an international cultural tourist city. 
The 428 meter-long street stretching from the Buyeong Theater in Nampo-dong to the overpass in Chungmu-dong was divided into “Star Street” and “Festival Street,” and on the eve of the festival each year the “BIFF Square Ground Opening” is held here. 
During the ceremony, events such as the hand printing of famous movie celebrities and Nunkkot Jeomdeung (snow-flower lighting) take place. 
A district such as BIFF Square, crowded with first-run theaters in a city is rare not only in Asia but Europe as well, and for this reason it holds great potential. 
In recent years, the square has grown into a more complex area, featuring not only movie theaters but also shops and leisure facilities, attracting growing numbers of young visitors and tourists.

### Fashion Street

Gwangbok-dong Cultural & Fashion Street is about 600 m long from the entrance to Gukje Market. 
The street has historically featured many clothing shops, and it is quite crowded at night or on weekends. 
Tourists often come here to visit the many Korean fashion and cosmetic shops. 
There are plenty of good restaurants in the area, which is a great place to feel the vitality and energy of Busan’s youth. 

### Busan Tower

Busan Tower, standing at 120 meters tall, is an iconic observation tower situated in Busan's Yongdusan Park. 
This tower offers visitors panoramic views of Busan Port and Yeongdo Island. 
A highlight is the nightly fireworks mapping show, where graphical displays are projected onto the windows, creating a mesmerizing backdrop against the colorful night view of Busan Port Bridge. 
The lower floor of the tower is a haven of amusement, themed around a flying submarine. 
On the second floor, visitors will find a photo zone and rooms decorated with themes representing famous travel destinations in Busan.

# Day 14

Day 14 of our trip is dedicated to the area close to our Airbnb, more central in the city.

## Seomyeon

Seomyeon is a major commercial center and transportation hub in Busan, South Korea.
The area grew from a small village in the Joseon period to a major industrial hub in the mid-20th century. 
It hosted numerous factories and businesses, including predecessors to the modern companies Samsung and LG. 
By the late 20th century, many of the factories moved away, and the area became the preeminent shopping and culture area of the city.
This neighborhood is a great place to go shopping and explore.

### Jeonpo Cafe Street

Jeonpo Café Street is a unique and vibrant street lined with diverse cafés. 
From specialty coffee shops to dessert cafés, bakeries, and brunch spots, visitors can choose from a wide range of options to suit their preferences. 
Many cafés in the area utilize various spaces, including renovated houses, factories, and warehouses, offering plenty of attractions and enjoyment. 



## Gwangalli Beach

Gwangalli Beach is 1.4 kilometers long and 25~110 meters wide, and is famous for its fine sand. 
The area underwent a water purification process, which led the ecosystem to flourish in the nearby river waters. 
In addition to the beachfront, the Gwangalli area is filled with delicious restaurants and romantic cafes, as well as stores selling famous fashion brands. 
The area has plenty to offer, but many people come in the evening to take in the bright lights of Gwangandaegyo Bridge, stretching across the horizon.

## SPA Land

It is Spa Land located in Busan’s landmark, Centum City. 
Introducing themed saunas and hot springs with historical significance, it is a place of healing beloved not only by Busan residents but also by travelers from all around the world.
This place seems like a great spot to relax after a few busy days of sightseeing.

# Day 15

## Skyline luge 

A skyline luge is a unique, gravity-fueled ride that combines the excitement of go-karting with the thrill of a roller coaster.
The luge track in Busan is the second one built in Korea.
Take the Skyride lift to the starting point, get on the specially designed luge cart for down riding, and enjoy a thrilling 2.4-kilometer ride down from four tracks.
This is a fun activity to break up the cultural sightseeing we have been doing so far.
