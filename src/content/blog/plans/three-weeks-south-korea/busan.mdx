## Gamcheon Culture Village

When reading about Busan, Gamcheon Culture Village pops out a lot. 
You can certainly not miss this colorful village.
The village was formed by the settlement of refugees during the Korean War in the 1950s.
The houses were built in a staircase style on the foothills of a coastal mountain.
The many alleys that cut through this community are vibrantly decorated with murals and sculptures created by the residents.
Many art students and professional artists were tasked to transform the village into a cultural attraction in 2009, making it such a colorful and photogenic place to visit.
In 2015, the village had 1.4 million visitors.

## Nampo-dong

Nampo-dong is a central commercial district in Busan. 
There are multiple shopping streets, including a Lotte Department Store, and other things that I mentioned below.

### Jagalchi Fish Market

The Jagalchi Fish Market is Korea’s largest seafood market and a must-visit when in Busan.
It is located right by the sea, so you can expect to find a wide variety of fresh seafood here.
The market is divided into two sections: the indoor market, where you can find dried and processed seafood, and the outdoor market, where you can find live and fresh seafood.
You can also find many restaurants in and around the market that will prepare the seafood you buy for you to eat on the spot.
Most of the people who sell fish are women, so the vendors here are called Jagalchi Ajumeoni, "ajumeoni" meaning middle-aged or married woman in Korean.

### BIFF square

Busan’s modern movie district was originally little more than a pair of cinemas that were built following Korea’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule over half a century ago. 
However, major renovations took place ahead of the first Busan International Film Festival (BIFF), and the newly transformed district was named BIFF Square on September 13, 1996.
Having been remade into a cultural tourist attraction promoting the advancement of Korea’s film industry, BIFF Square has contributed to Busan’s status as an international cultural tourist city. 
The 428 meter-long street stretching from the Buyeong Theater in Nampo-dong to the overpass in Chungmu-dong was divided into “Star Street” and “Festival Street,” and on the eve of the festival each year the “BIFF Square Ground Opening” is held here. 
During the ceremony, events such as the hand printing of famous movie celebrities and Nunkkot Jeomdeung (snow-flower lighting) take place. 
A district such as BIFF Square, crowded with first-run theaters in a city is rare not only in Asia but Europe as well, and for this reason it holds great potential. 
In recent years, the square has grown into a more complex area, featuring not only movie theaters but also shops and leisure facilities, attracting growing numbers of young visitors and tourists.

### Fashion Street

Gwangbok-dong Cultural & Fashion Street is about 600 m long from the entrance to Gukje Market. 
The street has historically featured many clothing shops, and it is quite crowded at night or on weekends. 
Tourists often come here to visit the many Korean fashion and cosmetic shops. 
There are plenty of good restaurants in the area, which is a great place to feel the vitality and energy of Busan’s youth. 

### Busan Tower

Busan Tower, standing at 120 meters tall, is an iconic observation tower situated in Busan's Yongdusan Park. 
This tower offers visitors panoramic views of Busan Port and Yeongdo Island. 
A highlight is the nightly fireworks mapping show, where graphical displays are projected onto the windows, creating a mesmerizing backdrop against the colorful night view of Busan Port Bridge. 
The lower floor of the tower is a haven of amusement, themed around a flying submarine. 
On the second floor, visitors will find a photo zone and rooms decorated with themes representing famous travel destinations in Busan.

# Day 14

Day 14 of our trip is dedicated to the area close to our Airbnb, more central in the city.

## Seomyeon

Seomyeon is a major commercial center and transportation hub in Busan, South Korea.
The area grew from a small village in the Joseon period to a major industrial hub in the mid-20th century. 
It hosted numerous factories and businesses, including predecessors to the modern companies Samsung and LG. 
By the late 20th century, many of the factories moved away, and the area became the preeminent shopping and culture area of the city.
This neighborhood is a great place to go shopping and explore.

### Jeonpo Cafe Street

Jeonpo Café Street is a unique and vibrant street lined with diverse cafés. 
From specialty coffee shops to dessert cafés, bakeries, and brunch spots, visitors can choose from a wide range of options to suit their preferences. 
Many cafés in the area utilize various spaces, including renovated houses, factories, and warehouses, offering plenty of attractions and enjoyment. 



## Gwangalli Beach

Gwangalli Beach is 1.4 kilometers long and 25~110 meters wide, and is famous for its fine sand. 
The area underwent a water purification process, which led the ecosystem to flourish in the nearby river waters. 
In addition to the beachfront, the Gwangalli area is filled with delicious restaurants and romantic cafes, as well as stores selling famous fashion brands. 
The area has plenty to offer, but many people come in the evening to take in the bright lights of Gwangandaegyo Bridge, stretching across the horizon.

## SPA Land

It is Spa Land located in Busan’s landmark, Centum City. 
Introducing themed saunas and hot springs with historical significance, it is a place of healing beloved not only by Busan residents but also by travelers from all around the world.
This place seems like a great spot to relax after a few busy days of sightseeing.

# Day 15

## Skyline luge 

A skyline luge is a unique, gravity-fueled ride that combines the excitement of go-karting with the thrill of a roller coaster.
The luge track in Busan is the second one built in Korea.
Take the Skyride lift to the starting point, get on the specially designed luge cart for down riding, and enjoy a thrilling 2.4-kilometer ride down from four tracks.
This is a fun activity to break up the cultural sightseeing we have been doing so far.

## Haedong Yonggungsa Temple

Haedong Yonggungsa Temple is a Buddhist temple located very close to the Skyline Luge.
Most temples in Korea are actually located in the mountains, which makes this temple located on the shore of the sea quite unique.
The temple was first built in 1376 by the great Buddhist teacher known as Naong during the Goryeo dynasty.

The main sanctuary of the temple was reconstructed in 1970 with careful attention paid to the colors that were traditionally used in such structures. 
On the right-hand side, inside a cave, is a uniquely designed Buddhist sanctum, while situated just in front of the main sanctuary is a three-story pagoda with four lions. 
The four lions symbolize joy, anger, sadness, and happiness. 
Other special sites at the temple are the 108 stairs and stone lanterns lining the rocky landscape. 
After going down the 108 steps, one will be delighted with the beauty of the temple. 
Midway down the 108 steps one can stop and enjoy the calming sounds of the waves, and view the majestic sunrise.

## Haeundae Beach

Haeundae Beach is the most popular/famous beach in South Korea.
The white sand beach is roughly 1.5 kilometers long, over a 30- to 50-meter wide area, creating a beautiful coastline before a shallow bay, making it perfect for swimming.
The beach is seen as a great spot for a summer getaway, with lots of accommodations and restaurants in the area.

### Blueline Park

One of the more popular attractions at Haeundae Beach is Blueline Park, a coastal train that runs along the shore from Haeundae to Songjeong Beach.
It is 4.8 kilometers long.
The train has large windows, allowing passengers to take in the beautiful coastal scenery as they ride along the shore.
According to some people, you could also walk this route, but if you are lazy like us, this train is a great way to see the sights.
However, you need to reserve tickets in advance, as it can get quite busy.
According to some people, it is easier to book tickets departing from Cheongsapo, since it is the less popular side. 
Then this will lead to Haeundae beach.

# Day 16

This day can be spent to explore the things we still want to see. 
Some suggestions located on the west side of the city are shown here. 

## Songdo Bay Station

The Songdo Marine Cable Car offers a captivating 15-minute ride from Songdo Base Station to Songdo Sky Park, treating visitors to picturesque views of Songdo Beach and Yeongdo Island.
It goes over the water, so I thought it was quite cool.
That is the main reason, I have nothing more to say about it.

## Huinnyeoul Culture Village   

Huinnyeoul Culture Village is a small village located on a cliff overlooking the sea.
Huinnyeoul was originally a small fishing village, but when many Korean War refugees fled here, it became tightly packed with narrow alleyways. 
In 2010, many local artists took efforts to remodel the area. Murals were painted, houses remodeled, and Huinnyeoul turned into a small village.

## Taejongda

Taejongdae Cliffed Coast was formed by many layers of rock being forced together beneath a lake during the Cretaceous period, and then worn away over time by the sea. 
The coast features many geological formations, including sea caves and uniquely shaped rocks. 
Visitors can enjoy walking on the forested paths, or take the train course to easily access Taejongdae Observatory and Yeongdo Coastal Culture Space.
There is also a lighthouse located at the end of the cliff, which is a popular spot for taking photos.
