### Cable car

If you are not really a hiker, you can also take the cable car up to Gwongeumseong Fortress.
From there, you can also hike a bit further up to the peak of the mountain.
This already provides a breath-taking view of the surrounding area.
Gwongeumseong Fortress is a stone castle from the Goryeo dynasty.

## Lakes

Sokcho is home to two beautiful lakes: Yeongnangho Lake and Cheongchoho Lake.
We will probably stumble upon one or both of them while exploring Sokcho.


### Yeongnangho Lake

Yeongnangho Lake is a deep and large lake with a circumference of 7.8 km, an area of about 1.2 km2, and a depth of over 8 m, formed by the development of coastal dunes. The source water originates from the Jangcheoncheon Stream, passing through the lake, and goes to the East Sea via the waterway under the Yeongnanggyo Bridge. 
The lake is adjacent to the areas of Jangsa-dong, Yeongnang-dong, Dongmyeong-dong, and Geumho-dong. The pleasant trail is also established around the lakeside, surrounded by the beautiful scenery of cherry blossoms, azaleas, and reeds.

### Cheongchoho Lake

Cheongchoho Lake, located in the center of Sokcho city, is a large natural lake with a circumference of 5 m and an area of 1.3 km2. The source water originates from the Misiryeong Valley of Taebaek Mountain Range and flows to the Cheongchocheon Stream and to this beautiful lake, and then continues to the adjacent sea. So, the lake is an intermediate stop between the river and the sea. Cheongchojeong Pavilion is located above the lake, offering an open view of Seoraksan Mountain and the East Sea. As it is situated at the end of the 75 m-long ocean bridge, you will feel standing in the middle of the lake and enjoy a panoramic view of the lake. Shining more at night, this pavilion is regarded as the best attraction for the beautiful night view in Sokcho.

## Abai Village

Abai Village bears a history of displaced people’s distress. The village was formed by refugees of the Korean War from North Korea, mainly from Hamgyeong-do Province. 
The word “abai” is a dialect of Hamgyeong-do that means a friendly old man like a grandfather. Visitors to Abai Village can get a sense of displaced people’s life and story, which fade away into a chapter of history. 
Although it has lost its original appearance now, old shacks without a gate still remain here and there. 
Mural paintings on the wall show the sentiment of nostalgia about their hometown and express sorrow and hard life of displaced people, who lived from hand to mouth by fishing and doing physical labor. 
The original houses built by refugees in the village were restored into the Refugee Village at the Sokcho Museum. 
Abai Village is also known as a filming location for the Korean TV drama Autumn in My Heart, attracting a lot of visitors and becoming a major attraction in Sokcho. 
The restaurant alley is packed with cafes and North Korean food restaurants serving local dishes such as Hamheung-style cold buckwheat noodles, stuffed squid, and North Korean-style sausage soup.
So this is the place where we will try some North Korean food.

## Yeonggeumjeong Sunrise Pavilion

Yeonggeumjeong refers to the area covering the shore by the Sokcho Lighthouse in Sokcho-si City. 
The name Yeonggeumjeong comes from a notion that the sound of waves hitting the rocks is comparable to the melody of geomungo (traditional stringed instrument with 6 strings). 
At the end of the 50m-long bridge built over a rocky peninsula is a pavilion offering a view of the East Sea.
