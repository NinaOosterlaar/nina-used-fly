# Day 11

- Arrive from the [Temple Stay](/blog/plans/three-weeks-south-korea/temple-stay-haeinsa) in Haeinsa to Naejangsan National Park (1.5 hour drive)

Naejangsan National Park is specifically known for its amazing Autumn foliage.
Since we will visit Korea during the Autumn season, this is a must-see destination
There are multiple hiking trails in the park, but there is also a cable car that can take you up to the top of the mountain, which is ideal for us.
There are also some pretty waterfalls: Dodeokpopko Waterfall, and Geumseonpopko Waterfall.
Additionally, there are some temples in the park, such as Naejangsa Temple and Baegyangsa Temple.
We will spend the afternoon exploring the park and appreciating the beautiful Autumn colors.

The park is called Naejangsan, since that is the name of the mountain.
The mountain is 762 meter high. 
Additionally, the area is home to 919 plant species, and 1880 animal species, 12 of them being endangered.
