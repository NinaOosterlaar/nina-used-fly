# Day 1: Travelling
10.40 our airplane to Frankfurt left. 
We arrived at Schiphol about 2.5 hours early, and had a very easy time going through all the security and everything. 
We mainly just chilled at the airport, until our flight. The flight to Frankfurt was 1 hour and 10 minutes. 
Our transfer took another 3 hours, which we also just spent at a cafe with electrical outlets, got to charge the phone. 
Then the daunting 12 hours flight started to Incheon Airport. 
I tried to sleep during the flight, which I think I managed for like 30 minutes. 
After finally landing, we passed immigration very easily because of our e-arrival card application, you should definitely do that if you are visiting South Korea.
After taking the 1 hour AREX train to Seoul and arriving there at around 2pm the next Day, our trip could finally start.


# Day 2: Arrival in Seoul
We arrived at the hotel a little bit before check-in time. 
Since we were starving, we decided to have lunch at a nearby place. 
Since our hotel is literally next to the main street of Myeongdong, we already got a good taste if the vibes. 
The vibes were: loud music, lots of colours, and Kpop (Demon Hunters). 
However, everyone was a bit overwhelmed by all the sensory stimuli while experiencing quite a jetlag. 
The first lunch was fine. We got some plate with pork and other side dishes, which was okay in my opinion. 
The Bibimbap was also nice enough but nothing special. 
The side dishes and the kimchi pancake were definitely the most tasty.
## Namsam
Our idea was to go to the iconic N Seoul tower to see the view of the city. 
So we walked to the cable car station. To reach the cable car station, there is a small elevator like cabin that you can use to reach the building of the cable car. 
You could also walk the stairs for a bit, but we were tired so we opted for the elevator. 
This queue already took like half an hour. However, when we finally reached the cable car building, the queue was even longer, like at least an hour. 
So we decided that took too long, so we skipped exploring Namsam park, and the N Seoul tower. 
We could see the tower from our hotel room, so that was good enough. 
To make up for this, we went to Namseongal * Hanok village, which is close to Namsam park. 
We first walked in the surrounding park, which was really peaceful, with all the pretty lights and beautiful trees. 
We reached a capsule * park, which is a place where the city stored * items in 19 * to be dug up at 2 * to memorise the current technology of that time, which is quite fun. 
We only found the actual Hanok village a little bit later, which was quite small but very cute. 
The building architecture was beautiful, and some items from back in the day were stored there. 
For example, a carriage which was used to carry the king and some other important people around. 
This carriage was so tiny, me and my sister were joking about how someone could ever fit in there, while simultaneously an Asian guy that was also visiting the place made the joke that we would never fit into it since, we are too tall. 
It was a funny interaction.

## Hotels
After lunch we exchanged some money and went to our hotel to freshen up a bit. Like the reviews already said, the rooms were quite small, so if you have a very big suitcase it is quite inconvenient. However, the location is amazing, and the rooms are clean and comfortable. The toilet even has some extra functions, which you often see in Asian countries. 
## Food
### Day 1
After the hanok village, we tried to get some food. However, a lot of the places were already full. We ended up at a place close to our hotel where we eat some dinner and met some other Dutch people that were sitting next to us. I forgot to make a picture of our dinner, but we had some fried chicken, shrimp, korean dumplings, and some pork in a sweet sauce. It was nice. 
### Day 2
After the aquarium, we ate some lunch at a place in the mall. We all ate some Kulgusuka*, which was great, because it contains Udon noodles. I actually did make a picture of this dish!
We did manage to find a place to eat, and got some food recommendation from a middle aged couple from Hong Kong. We ate some Bimbibap* and noodle soup, which where tasty and some other very nice pancake-esque (but then completely different than pancakes, I know terrible description lol) that were really good!
