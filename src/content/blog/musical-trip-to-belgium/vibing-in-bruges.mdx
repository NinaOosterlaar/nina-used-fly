# Bruges

Bruges first impression: what a very pretty and overcrowded city. 
We walked from Bruges station to our family-owned hotel, which was a ten-minute walk through a park. 
The hotel is in the city center, and since the whole city center is pretty, it speaks for itself that the hotel and its surroundings were also very pretty. 
The hotel was less than a five-minute walk to the St. Salvator’s Cathedral, so naturally that was our first stop!

## St. Salvator’s Cathedral

The St. Salvator’s Cathedral is the main church in the city. The outside looks pretty enough, but a little bit rough as well. 
The inside of the church looks, just like all churches, very pretty, although a little bit more basic than churches in other countries. 
The main feature of this church are the wall-carpets, which were manufactured by Jasper van der Borcht in 1731. 
They display various scenes of the life of Jesus. Additionally, like any other catholic church, the place is surrounded by religious art everywhere.  
Overall, it is a pretty church where you should spend some time to look around, but you can see it all quite quickly.

## The Market Square

Then we walked through the steenstraat, which is one of the prettier streets in Brugge and also the main shopping street, to the market. 
The market is probably one of the prettiest sights in Bruges, it contains a lot of medieval style building, the Belfort tower, and the provincial building. 
However, this also makes it one of the busiest places in the city. 
We walked around the square, visited a small bookstore, and took some pictures. 
However, the next day there would be a festival in the square, which meant that the square was partly under construction, which limited the picture potential.
One of the best part of the square (and the whole city) are the many horses and carriages that you can see everywhere. 
I never dare to ride in one, since I am still not sure how well the horses are treated, but they do look so cute. 
If you are interested to take a horse ride, I think it was 70 euros, so if you are with a group, it is not that expensive.

The main sight of the square is the Belfort tower, which is a medieval bell tower.
It is 83 meters high and you can climb it for a great view over the city (which we did not do, but you could).
Back in the day, the tower was mainly used as a market hall and a treasury.
It was basically the center of the city.
Another activity you can do in the square is to visit the Historium Bruges, which is a museum about the history of Bruges.
We did not visit it, but it looked interesting and I would definitely visit it if I had more time.

## A Misguided Walk Through Bruges

Sebas wanted to visit a board game shop that was recommended by a friend, so we walked there. 
However, he navigated us to the wrong shop, since this particularly shop was only a webshop with an associated address to the owner's home.
So we took a scenic walk through the city, until we ended up in a random neighbourhood.
This sounds very lame, but the walk was actually very nice.
