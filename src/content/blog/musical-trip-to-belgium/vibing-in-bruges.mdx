# Bruges

Bruges first impression: what a very pretty and overcrowded city. We walked from Bruges station to our family-owned hotel, which was a ten-minute walk through a park. The hotel is in the city center, and since the whole city center is pretty, it speaks for itself that the hotel and its surroundings was also very pretty. The hotel was less than a five-minute walk to the St. Salvator’s Cathedral, so naturally that was our first stop!

## St. Salvator’s Cathedral

The St. Salvator’s Cathedral is the main church in the city. The outside looks pretty enough, but a little bit rough as well. The inside of the church looks, just like all churches, very pretty, although a little bit more basic than churches in other countries. The main feature of this church are the wall-carpets, which were manufactured by Jasper van der Borcht in 1731. They display various scenes of the life of Jesus. Additionally, like any other catholic church, the place is surrounded by religious art everywhere.  Overall, it is a pretty church where you should spend some time to look around, but you can see it all quite quickly.

## The Market Square

Then we walked through the  steenstraat, which is one of the prettier streets in Brugge and also the main shopping street, to the market. The market is probably one of the prettiest sights in Bruges, it contains a lot of medieval style building, the Belfort tower, and the provincial building. However, this also makes it one of the busiest places in the city.
