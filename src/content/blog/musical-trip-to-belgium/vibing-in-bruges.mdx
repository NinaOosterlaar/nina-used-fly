# Bruges Day 1

Bruges first impression: what a very pretty and overcrowded city. 
We walked from Bruges station to our family-owned hotel, which was a ten-minute walk through a park. 
The hotel is in the city center, and since the whole city center is pretty, it speaks for itself that the hotel and its surroundings were also very pretty. 
The hotel was less than a five-minute walk to the St. Salvator’s Cathedral, so naturally that was our first stop!

## St. Salvator’s Cathedral

The St. Salvator’s Cathedral is the main church in the city. The outside looks pretty enough, but a little bit rough as well. 
The inside of the church looks, just like all churches, very pretty, although a little bit more basic than churches in other countries. 
The main feature of this church are the wall-carpets, which were manufactured by Jasper van der Borcht in 1731. 
They display various scenes of the life of Jesus. Additionally, like any other catholic church, the place is surrounded by religious art everywhere.  
Overall, it is a pretty church where you should spend some time to look around, but you can see it all quite quickly.

## The Market Square

Then we walked through the steenstraat, which is one of the prettier streets in Brugge and also the main shopping street, to the market. 
The market is probably one of the prettiest sights in Bruges, it contains a lot of medieval style building, the Belfort tower, and the provincial building. 
However, this also makes it one of the busiest places in the city. 
We walked around the square, visited a small bookstore, and took some pictures. 
However, the next day there would be a festival in the square, which meant that the square was partly under construction, which limited the picture potential.
One of the best part of the square (and the whole city) are the many horses and carriages that you can see everywhere. 
I never dare to ride in one, since I am still not sure how well the horses are treated, but they do look so cute. 
If you are interested to take a horse ride, I think it was 70 euros, so if you are with a group, it is not that expensive.

The main sight of the square is the Belfort tower, which is a medieval bell tower.
It is 83 meters high and you can climb it for a great view over the city (which we did not do, but you could).
Back in the day, the tower was mainly used as a market hall and a treasury.
It was basically the center of the city.
Another activity you can do in the square is to visit the Historium Bruges, which is a museum about the history of Bruges.
We did not visit it, but it looked interesting and I would definitely visit it if I had more time.

## A Misguided Walk Through Bruges

Sebas wanted to visit a board game shop that was recommended by a friend, so we walked there. 
However, he navigated us to the wrong shop, since this particularly shop was only a webshop with an associated address to the owner's home.
So we took a scenic walk through the city, until we ended up in a random neighbourhood.
This sounds very lame, but the walk was actually very nice.
We walked through cute streets, and saw some pretty buildings.
And because we walked to a random neighbourhood, the streets we crosed were not as busy so it was quite peaceful.
So if you are ever in Bruges, keep in mind that the whole city center is very pretty and medieval, so you can just walk around and enjoy the sights anywhere.

## Continuing Aimlessly Walking through Bruges

So we did not actually have a plan for the rest of the day, so we just walked around some more to get an idea of the city.
After grabbing a quick snack, we walked back to the Market Square, and continued on to the town hall which was located at a square next to the market square.
The town hall is very pretty, but because of the festival preparations, there was a big stage in front of it, so we could not really appreciate it.
You will also have to do without a picture.
Around the corner of the town hall, there is one of the take-off points of the canal boat tours.
This specific place was also very cute and pretty, and there was a very small art market going on as well. 
At some point we stumbled upon a small park, which was also pretty and probably peaceful if there were no festival preparations going on.

After our walk, we decided to go have dinner. 
I still suck at this blog thing, so I did not take any pictures or notes on the food, I will try to do that in the future.
On the way to the restaurant, we could go to a board game shop if we took a small detour.
Sebas was really excited about this, however when we arrived there, it was closed for several weeks.
The board game shops were not really on our side this trip.
The typical Belgian food was okay, but nothing special.
After dinner we walked back to the hotel, since we were still really tired from the concert the day before.
We had a nice view of the St. Salvator’s Cathedral from our hotel room, since it was lit up at night.
And that was our first day in Bruges!

# Bruges Day 2

Day 2 of Bruges was packed with plans. 
We took the first canal boat tour of the day at 10.00 AM.
The hotel owner recommended this, since it is less busy in the morning, and she was right.
Afterwards we would visit the O.L.V. Church, with the famous Michelangelo statue.
At 15.15 we had a reservation at the Halve Maan Brewery, but before that we visited the Begijnhof.
After the brewery we had pasta for dinner, and then we would go to the Festival Benenwerk, which is a yearly dance and music festival in the city center.
