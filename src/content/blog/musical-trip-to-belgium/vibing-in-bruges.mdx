# Bruges

Bruges first impression: what a very pretty and overcrowded city. We walked from Bruges station to our family-owned hotel, which was a ten-minute walk through a park. The hotel is in the city center, and since the whole city center is pretty, it speaks for itself that the hotel and its surroundings was also very pretty. The hotel was less than a five-minute walk to the St. Salvator’s Cathedral, so naturally that was our first stop!
