# Ghent

The train home from Bruges stopped in Ghent, so we decided to spend a few hours exploring the city.
We arrived at the train station Dampoort, which did look quite rough.
From there we still had to walk a bit to reach the city center, and this walk is not particularly pretty.
But when arriving in the city centre, it does start to become prettier.
It is however not the same as Bruges, where every house in every street is picturesque.
We decided to first go to the Gravensteen, a castle in the middle of the city.
Going there, we passed some nice buildings and streets and slowly started to get into the vibe of the city.

## Gravensteen

We arrived at the Gravensteen without tickets. 
We could buy them there for a slot one hour later.
Thus we ate a waffle in a nearby cafe and then went back again.
An audioguide is included in your ticket. 
There are two options, an informational one of half an hour and a comedy one of 1 hour.
The comedy one is narrated by a local comedian and includes funny anecdotes and jokes about the castle's history.
We chose the comedy tour, but were skeptical at first.
Was this going to be boomer humor?
Well, after the first part, we were pleasantly surprised.
It actually was quite enjoyable and funny to listen to.
So we made our way through the castle with the comedian in our ears.

First, he told us about the history of the castle and its significance in medieval times.
He explained how stone houses were a symbol of wealth and power during that era, thus inspiring the count of Flanders to build the Gravensteen as a demonstration of his authority.
We entered several rooms, each with its own unique features and stories.
For example, we saw one of the first fireplaces.
Additionally, the comedian told us about two counts who lived there and their love stories.
One of the stories being very romantic, and the other one really tragic.
He told us about the customs and traditions of the time, showing us toilets and swords and armor from that era.
The different methods of punishment and torture were also touched upon in great detail.
All of this was accompanied with a lighthearted tone and an interesting narrative built around the people.
Also good to note, the tour includes a nice view over the city from the top of the castle.
If you are going to Gent, I really recommend going to this castle, and taking the comedy audioguide.
