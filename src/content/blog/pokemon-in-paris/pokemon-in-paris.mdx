# Pokémon in Paris

Between June 13-15 Pokémon GO Fest Paris was taking place.
For anyone who does not play Pokémon Go but still wants to read this for some reason, Go Fest is a special event in the game.
One morning or afternoon you can go to a specific location (usually a park) in the city to participate in various activities, catch exclusive (shiny) Pokémon, and enjoy the festive/Pokémon atmosphere.
For the rest of the days you can explore the city while catching those same special Pokémon.
During these events, the city is filled with players, making it feel like the initial Pokémon launch times. 
On the 13th we arrived in the evening, after a very loud train ride (we were sitting in the same carriage as a high school class), and the next morning our park experience began.

## The Park Experience

The park experience was held in Parc de Sceaux, a large park south of Paris.
The entire park is massive, but the event was held in a specific area near the Château de Sceaux.
This specific area was also quite large, and filled with Pokémon players.
A lot of them were dressed up in Pokémon-themed clothing, which is just great to see.   
Their are four different zones in the game, which are all represented in the park by some decorations.
Each of these zones has its own selection of Pokeémon that can be caught.
These zones were located vertically next to each other, with the middle containing gyms where you can battle raid bosses, specifically Zacian and Zamazenta.
This structure resulted in a good overview of the park, however if you wanted to visit the zones on the opposite side of the park, you had to walk a bit.

The park was also filled with other attractions, like a big merchandise stand, food trucks, a spot where you can get your picture taken with a giant Pikachu/Eevee/Snorlax/Mimikyu, and so much more.
I already took a picture with Eevee when playing Go Fest in London, so we skipped this.
However, this was before I realised that you could take a picture with Snorlax, which I now missed...
We pre-ordered two shirts which you can pick up at the side of the merchandise stand.
Since the guards did not pay attention at all, you could easily sneak into the actual store, skipping the huge line.
This was great, and so we managed to buy a Raichu and Captain Pikachu plushie :). 
Overall, we enjoyed our time there and caught a lot of shiny Pokémon, so it was definitely a success.

## Jardin du Luxembourg: the second park experience

After the park experience, we had the rest of the day to explore Paris.
We randomly chose to visit Jardin du Luxembourg, a park in the center of Paris.
This turned out ot be the place to be for Pokémon GO players.
The park is filled with gyms, and there were so many players, even international famous ones.
We have spent a lot of time in this park over our two day visit in Paris.
And some point, some French girls asked us why everyone was wearing Pokémon merch (we were also wearing merch), because the park looked so insane.
But we did not want to spent the whole weekend in the park, so we also did some sightseeing.

## The Eiffel Tower can't be that far, right? RIGHT??
